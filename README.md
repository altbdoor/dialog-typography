Provides a central place to manage your typography across multiple breakpoints.

## Installation üíæ

```
npm install dialog-typography
```

## Usage ‚òùÔ∏è

1. Set up your favorite breakpoint mixin.
   `typo` will call a mixin called `bp($breakpointname)`. So it **important** to
   set up your own breakpoint mixin within a mixin called `bp`.

   For example:

   ```scss
   $breakpoints: (
      desktop: 'min-width: 701px',
      mobile: 'max-wdith: 700px'
   );

   @mixin bp($name) {
     @media (#{map-get($breakpoints, $name)}) {
       @content
     }
   }
   ```

   Or you could also use any [popular breakpoint mixin](https://github.com/inuitcss/tools.responsive/blob/master/_tools.responsive.scss)

   ```scss
   @mixin bp($name)
     @inlcude media-query($name) {
       @content
     }
   }
   ```

2. Import `dialog-typography.scss` after the creation of the `bp` mixin.

    ```scss
    @import 'dialog-typography/dist/dialog-typography';
    ```
    PS: make sure to add `node_modules` to your [import paths](https://github.com/sass/node-sass#includepaths)
